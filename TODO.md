# Robot TODO List

Please ensure that you add anything left half-finished to the list, and remove anything you finished.

## Shooter
- [ ] Fix Constants.java
- [ ] Tune low/mid/high velocities
- [ ] Fix trapezoid profile constraints
- [ ] Tune feedforward as needed. kV should theoretically already be pretty close, kS definitely needs tuning

    - [ ] EX: (button) -> .onTrue -> shooter.setVelocity(lowVel);
- [ ] Make auto rpm calculator command
- [ ] Figure out inversion

## Intake
- [ ] Fix CAN ID in Constants.java
- [ ] Figure out inversion
- [ ] Test different motor power levels w/ build team

## Vision
- [ ] Fix camera offsets to robot
- [ ] Add utility other than pose estimation
- [ ] Check if we need to call to periodic
